# AddStore_
**Add a store in the version of Windows 10 where it is not!**

If you need a Microsoft store in Windows 10 LTSB, LTSC, Windows Server 2016, 2019, this script will do it! He sets all the necessary elements for the shop and the shop itself. At the same time, you get full functionality and you can, for example, buy an application and login to your Microsoft account!

## Using:
1. Download and unzip the latest release.
2. Open the .cmd file as an administrator.
3. Wait for Done and restart your computer.
4. Open the Microsoft Store and get updates.
5. Congratulations! You muck a normal UWP system by shit.

### Nothing works!
1. Try turning the computer off and on again.
2. What? Did not help? Then write me a message: userfriendlyinterface1@gmail.com.
